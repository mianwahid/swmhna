**Events:**

* **`AdminChanged(address indexed proxy, address indexed admin)`:** Emitted when the admin of a proxy contract is changed.
* **`Upgraded(address indexed proxy, address indexed implementation)`:** Emitted when the implementation for a proxy is upgraded.
* **`Deployed(address indexed proxy, address indexed implementation, address indexed admin)`:** Emitted when a new proxy is deployed.

**Error Handling:**

The contract uses custom errors for specific error cases, making it easier to understand the reason for a transaction revert:

* **`Unauthorized()`:** Thrown when a function is called by an address that is not authorized to perform the action.
* **`DeploymentFailed()`:** Thrown when the deployment of a proxy contract fails.
* **`UpgradeFailed()`:** Thrown when the upgrade of a proxy contract fails.
* **`SaltDoesNotStartWithCaller()`:** Thrown when attempting to deploy a deterministic proxy with a salt that does not start with either the zero address or the caller's address.

This comprehensive breakdown explains the functionalities of the ERC1967Factory smart contract, providing a clear understanding of its capabilities and how it can be used to manage upgradeable proxy contracts.
