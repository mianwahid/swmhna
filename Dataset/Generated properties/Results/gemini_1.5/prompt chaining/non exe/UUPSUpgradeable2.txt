## Test Invariants for UUPSUpgradeable Contract

This list outlines test invariants for the provided `UUPSUpgradeable` contract, focusing on edge cases and covering all functionalities:

**1. `upgradeToAndCall` Function:**

**a) Authorization:**

- **Invariant:** `upgradeToAndCall` MUST revert with `UnauthorizedCallContext` if called directly and not through a proxy.
- **Invariant:** `upgradeToAndCall` MUST revert if `_authorizeUpgrade` reverts (e.g., unauthorized sender).

**b) Implementation Validity:**

- **Invariant:** `upgradeToAndCall` MUST revert with `UpgradeFailed` if `newImplementation` doesn't implement `proxiableUUID` correctly (returns incorrect slot).
- **Invariant:** `upgradeToAndCall` MUST revert with `UpgradeFailed` if `newImplementation` is the zero address.

**c) State Updates and Events:**

- **Invariant:** `upgradeToAndCall` MUST update the implementation address stored at `_ERC1967_IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT` to `newImplementation` on success.
- **Invariant:** `upgradeToAndCall` MUST emit the `Upgraded` event with `newImplementation` on success.

**d) Delegatecall Behavior:**

- **Invariant:** `upgradeToAndCall` MUST perform a delegatecall to `newImplementation` with the provided `data` if `data.length > 0`.
- **Invariant:** `upgradeToAndCall` MUST NOT perform a delegatecall if `data.length == 0`.
- **Invariant:** `upgradeToAndCall` MUST bubble up any revert from the delegatecall to `newImplementation`.

**2. `proxiableUUID` Function:**

- **Invariant:** `proxiableUUID` MUST always return the value of `_ERC1967_IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT`.
- **Invariant:** `proxiableUUID` MUST revert with `UnauthorizedCallContext` if called through a delegate call.

**3. Modifiers:**

**a) `onlyProxy` Modifier:**

- **Invariant:** Functions using `onlyProxy` MUST revert with `UnauthorizedCallContext` if called directly and not through a proxy.

**b) `notDelegated` Modifier:**

- **Invariant:** Functions using `notDelegated` MUST revert with `UnauthorizedCallContext` if called through a delegate call.

**4. Edge Cases:**

- **Zero Address:** Test with `newImplementation` as the zero address in `upgradeToAndCall`.
- **Empty Data:** Test `upgradeToAndCall` with empty `data` to ensure no delegatecall occurs.
- **Reverted Delegatecall:** Test `upgradeToAndCall` with `data` that causes the delegatecall to revert, ensuring the revert is bubbled up.
- **Different Implementations:** Test upgrading to different implementations consecutively, ensuring state is updated correctly each time.

**5. Security Considerations:**

- **Invariant:** The `_authorizeUpgrade` function MUST be overridden in inheriting contracts to implement appropriate access control mechanisms, preventing unauthorized upgrades.

**These test invariants provide a comprehensive framework for testing the `UUPSUpgradeable` contract, ensuring its functionality and security. By focusing on edge cases and potential vulnerabilities, these tests help guarantee the contract's reliability and robustness.**
