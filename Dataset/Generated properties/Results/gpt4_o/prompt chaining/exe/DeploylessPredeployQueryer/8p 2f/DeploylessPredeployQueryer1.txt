The provided smart contract, `DeploylessPredeployQueryer`, is designed to be used in a deployless manner, meaning it is not intended to be deployed on the blockchain but rather used via a static `eth_call`. This contract is useful for querying predeploys and generating ERC-6492 compliant signatures. Below is a detailed explanation of its functionalities:

### 1. Custom Errors
```solidity
error ReturnedAddressMismatch();
```
- **ReturnedAddressMismatch**: This custom error is used to indicate that the address returned by the factory does not match the provided address. This is a safeguard to ensure that the correct contract is being interacted with.

### 2. Constructor
```solidity
constructor(
    address target,
    bytes[] memory targetQueryCalldata,
    address factory,
    bytes memory factoryCalldata
) payable
```
The constructor is the core of this contract and performs several key functions:

#### Parameters:
- **target**: The address of the contract to query.
- **targetQueryCalldata**: An array of calldata bytes to be used for querying the target contract.
- **factory**: The address of the factory contract that can deploy the target contract if it does not exist.
- **factoryCalldata**: The calldata to be used for calling the factory contract to deploy the target contract.

#### Functionality:
1. **Check if Target Exists**:
    ```solidity
    if iszero(extcodesize(target)) {
    ```
    - This checks if the target contract already exists by checking its code size.

2. **Deploy Target if it Does Not Exist**:
    ```solidity
    if iszero(
        call(
            gas(),
            factory,
            selfbalance(),
            add(factoryCalldata, 0x20),
            mload(factoryCalldata),
            m,
            0x20
        )
    ) {
        returndatacopy(m, 0x00, returndatasize())
        revert(m, returndatasize())
    }
    ```
    - If the target contract does not exist, it calls the factory contract to deploy it using the provided `factoryCalldata`.

3. **Verify Deployed Address**:
    ```solidity
    if iszero(and(gt(returndatasize(), 0x1f), eq(mload(m), target))) {
        mstore(0x00, 0xd1f6b812) // `ReturnedAddressMismatch()`.
        revert(0x1c, 0x04)
    }
    ```
    - After deployment, it verifies that the address returned by the factory matches the provided target address. If not, it reverts with the `ReturnedAddressMismatch` error.

4. **Query the Target Contract**:
    ```solidity
    let l := mload(targetQueryCalldata)
    let n := shl(5, l)
    let r := add(m, 0x40)
    let o := add(r, n)
    for { let i := 0 } iszero(eq(i, n)) { i := add(0x20, i) } {
        let j := mload(add(add(targetQueryCalldata, 0x20), i))
        if iszero(
            call(gas(), target, selfbalance(), add(j, 0x20), mload(j), codesize(), 0x00)
        ) {
            returndatacopy(m, 0x00, returndatasize())
            revert(m, returndatasize())
        }
        mstore(add(r, i), sub(o, r))
        mstore(o, returndatasize())
        returndatacopy(add(o, 0x20), 0x00, returndatasize())
        o := and(add(add(o, returndatasize()), 0x3f), not(0x1f))
    }
    ```
    - It iterates over the `targetQueryCalldata` array and makes calls to the target contract using each calldata entry.
    - The results of these calls are stored in memory.

5. **Return the Results**:
    ```solidity
    mstore(m, 0x20)
    mstore(add(m, 0x20), l)
    return(m, sub(o, m))
    ```
    - Finally, it returns the results of the queries as an array of bytes.

### Summary
The `DeploylessPredeployQueryer` contract is a utility for querying predeploys without actually deploying the contract itself. It ensures that the target contract exists (deploying it if necessary), performs a series of queries on the target contract, and returns the results. This is particularly useful for generating ERC-6492 compliant signatures and other similar use cases where deployless interaction is beneficial.
