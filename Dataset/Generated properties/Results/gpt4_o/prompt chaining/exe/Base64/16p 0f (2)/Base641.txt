The provided smart contract is a Solidity library named `Base64` that provides functionalities for encoding and decoding data using the Base64 encoding scheme. Below is a detailed explanation of each functionality provided by this library:

### 1. `encode(bytes memory data, bool fileSafe, bool noPadding)`

#### Description:
This function encodes the given `data` using the Base64 encoding scheme as described in RFC 4648. It provides options to make the encoding file-safe and to remove padding.

#### Parameters:
- `data`: The input data to be encoded.
- `fileSafe`: A boolean flag indicating whether to replace '+' with '-' and '/' with '_'.
- `noPadding`: A boolean flag indicating whether to strip away the padding.

#### Returns:
- `result`: The Base64 encoded string.

#### Implementation Details:
- The function calculates the length of the encoded data.
- It uses inline assembly for efficient memory manipulation and encoding.
- It stores the Base64 character table in memory and processes the input data in chunks of 3 bytes.
- Depending on the `fileSafe` flag, it adjusts the character table.
- It handles padding based on the `noPadding` flag.
- The encoded result is stored in memory and returned.

### 2. `encode(bytes memory data)`

#### Description:
This function encodes the given `data` using the Base64 encoding scheme with default settings (not file-safe and with padding).

#### Parameters:
- `data`: The input data to be encoded.

#### Returns:
- `result`: The Base64 encoded string.

#### Implementation Details:
- This function is a wrapper around the main `encode` function with `fileSafe` and `noPadding` set to `false`.

### 3. `encode(bytes memory data, bool fileSafe)`

#### Description:
This function encodes the given `data` using the Base64 encoding scheme with an option to make the encoding file-safe. Padding is included by default.

#### Parameters:
- `data`: The input data to be encoded.
- `fileSafe`: A boolean flag indicating whether to replace '+' with '-' and '/' with '_'.

#### Returns:
- `result`: The Base64 encoded string.

#### Implementation Details:
- This function is a wrapper around the main `encode` function with `noPadding` set to `false`.

### 4. `decode(string memory data)`

#### Description:
This function decodes a Base64 encoded string back into its original byte representation. It supports both standard and file-safe Base64 encoding as well as RFC 3501 (where 63 is ',').

#### Parameters:
- `data`: The Base64 encoded string to be decoded.

#### Returns:
- `result`: The decoded byte array.

#### Implementation Details:
- The function calculates the length of the decoded data.
- It uses inline assembly for efficient memory manipulation and decoding.
- It processes the input data in chunks of 4 bytes.
- It handles both padded and non-padded Base64 strings.
- The decoded result is stored in memory and returned.

### Summary:
The `Base64` library provides efficient and flexible functions for encoding and decoding data using the Base64 scheme. It supports options for file-safe encoding and padding removal, and it uses inline assembly for optimized performance. The library includes:
- A main `encode` function with customizable options.
- Two wrapper `encode` functions for common use cases.
- A `decode` function for converting Base64 strings back to their original byte representation.
