The provided smart contract is a library named `SSTORE2` that allows for efficient storage and retrieval of data on the Ethereum blockchain. It achieves this by deploying small contracts that store the data in their bytecode, which can then be read back. Below is a detailed explanation of each functionality provided by the contract:

### Constants

1. **DATA_OFFSET**
   ```solidity
   uint256 internal constant DATA_OFFSET = 1;
   ```
   - This constant is used to skip the first byte of the deployed contract's bytecode, which is a STOP opcode. This ensures that the contract cannot be called.

### Custom Errors

2. **DeploymentFailed**
   ```solidity
   error DeploymentFailed();
   ```
   - This error is thrown when the deployment of a storage contract fails.

3. **InvalidPointer**
   ```solidity
   error InvalidPointer();
   ```
   - This error is thrown when an invalid storage contract address is provided.

4. **ReadOutOfBounds**
   ```solidity
   error ReadOutOfBounds();
   ```
   - This error is thrown when an attempt is made to read outside the bounds of the storage contract's bytecode.

### Write Logic

5. **write**
   ```solidity
   function write(bytes memory data) internal returns (address pointer)
   ```
   - This function writes the provided `data` into the bytecode of a new storage contract and returns its address.
   - It prefixes the data with a STOP opcode to ensure the contract cannot be called.
   - If the deployment fails, it reverts with the `DeploymentFailed` error.

6. **writeDeterministic**
   ```solidity
   function writeDeterministic(bytes memory data, bytes32 salt) internal returns (address pointer)
   ```
   - This function writes the provided `data` into the bytecode of a new storage contract using a deterministic address derived from the provided `salt`.
   - It uses the `create2` opcode to deploy the contract.
   - If the deployment fails, it reverts with the `DeploymentFailed` error.

### Utility Functions

7. **initCodeHash**
   ```solidity
   function initCodeHash(bytes memory data) internal pure returns (bytes32 hash)
   ```
   - This function returns the initialization code hash of the storage contract for the provided `data`.
   - It is useful for mining vanity addresses with `create2crunch`.

8. **predictDeterministicAddress**
   ```solidity
   function predictDeterministicAddress(bytes memory data, bytes32 salt, address deployer) internal pure returns (address predicted)
   ```
   - This function returns the address of the storage contract for the provided `data` deployed with the given `salt` by the specified `deployer`.
   - The returned address has dirty upper 96 bits, which should be cleaned if used in assembly.

### Read Logic

9. **read**
   ```solidity
   function read(address pointer) internal view returns (bytes memory data)
   ```
   - This function returns all the `data` from the bytecode of the storage contract at the specified `pointer`.
   - It checks if the provided address is valid and reverts with `InvalidPointer` if not.

10. **read (with start)**
    ```solidity
    function read(address pointer, uint256 start) internal view returns (bytes memory data)
    ```
    - This function returns the `data` from the bytecode of the storage contract at the specified `pointer`, starting from the byte at `start` to the end of the data.
    - It checks if the provided address is valid and if the `start` index is within bounds, reverting with `InvalidPointer` or `ReadOutOfBounds` if not.

11. **read (with start and end)**
    ```solidity
    function read(address pointer, uint256 start, uint256 end) internal view returns (bytes memory data)
    ```
    - This function returns the `data` from the bytecode of the storage contract at the specified `pointer`, from the byte at `start` to the byte at `end` (exclusive).
    - It checks if the provided address is valid and if the `start` and `end` indices are within bounds, reverting with `InvalidPointer` or `ReadOutOfBounds` if not.

### Summary

The `SSTORE2` library provides a cost-efficient way to store and retrieve data on the Ethereum blockchain by deploying small contracts that store the data in their bytecode. It includes functions for writing data to these storage contracts, both deterministically and non-deterministically, and for reading the data back. The library also includes utility functions for predicting deterministic addresses and computing initialization code hashes. Custom errors are used to handle various failure scenarios, ensuring robust and predictable behavior.
