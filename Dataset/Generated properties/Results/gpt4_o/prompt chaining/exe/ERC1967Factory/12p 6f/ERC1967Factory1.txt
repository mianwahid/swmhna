The provided smart contract, `ERC1967Factory`, is a factory contract for deploying and managing ERC1967 proxy contracts. Below is a detailed explanation of its functionalities:

### Custom Errors
1. **Unauthorized**: Thrown when the caller is not authorized to call a function.
2. **DeploymentFailed**: Thrown when the proxy deployment fails.
3. **UpgradeFailed**: Thrown when the upgrade of the proxy fails.
4. **SaltDoesNotStartWithCaller**: Thrown when the provided salt does not start with the caller's address.

### Events
1. **AdminChanged**: Emitted when the admin of a proxy contract is changed.
   - Parameters: `proxy` (address of the proxy), `admin` (new admin address).
2. **Upgraded**: Emitted when the implementation of a proxy is upgraded.
   - Parameters: `proxy` (address of the proxy), `implementation` (new implementation address).
3. **Deployed**: Emitted when a new proxy is deployed.
   - Parameters: `proxy` (address of the proxy), `implementation` (implementation address), `admin` (admin address).

### Storage Constants
1. **_IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT**: The storage slot for the implementation in the proxy, calculated as `uint256(keccak256("eip1967.proxy.implementation")) - 1`.

### Admin Functions
1. **adminOf(address proxy)**: Returns the admin of the specified proxy.
   - Uses inline assembly to load the admin address from storage.

2. **changeAdmin(address proxy, address admin)**: Sets the admin of the specified proxy.
   - Checks if the caller is the current admin of the proxy.
   - Updates the admin address in storage.
   - Emits the `AdminChanged` event.

### Upgrade Functions
1. **upgrade(address proxy, address implementation)**: Upgrades the proxy to point to a new implementation.
   - Calls `upgradeAndCall` with an empty data payload.

2. **upgradeAndCall(address proxy, address implementation, bytes calldata data)**: Upgrades the proxy to a new implementation and optionally calls the proxy with provided data.
   - Checks if the caller is the current admin of the proxy.
   - Sets up the calldata to upgrade the proxy.
   - Attempts to upgrade the proxy and reverts if it fails.
   - Emits the `Upgraded` event.

### Deploy Functions
1. **deploy(address implementation, address admin)**: Deploys a new proxy with the specified implementation and admin.
   - Calls `deployAndCall` with an empty data payload.

2. **deployAndCall(address implementation, address admin, bytes calldata data)**: Deploys a new proxy with the specified implementation and admin, and optionally calls the proxy with provided data.
   - Calls `_deploy` with the provided parameters and an empty salt.

3. **deployDeterministic(address implementation, address admin, bytes32 salt)**: Deploys a new proxy with the specified implementation and admin using a deterministic address.
   - Calls `deployDeterministicAndCall` with an empty data payload.

4. **deployDeterministicAndCall(address implementation, address admin, bytes32 salt, bytes calldata data)**: Deploys a new proxy with the specified implementation and admin using a deterministic address, and optionally calls the proxy with provided data.
   - Checks if the salt starts with the zero address or the caller's address.
   - Calls `_deploy` with the provided parameters and the salt.

### Internal Deploy Function
1. **_deploy(address implementation, address admin, bytes32 salt, bool useSalt, bytes calldata data)**: Internal function to deploy a proxy, with optionality to deploy deterministically with a salt.
   - Creates the proxy using `create` or `create2` based on the `useSalt` flag.
   - Sets the implementation of the proxy.
   - Stores the admin address in storage.
   - Emits the `Deployed` event.

### Helper Functions
1. **predictDeterministicAddress(bytes32 salt)**: Returns the address of the proxy that would be deployed with the specified salt.
   - Computes the address using the `create2` deterministic address formula.

2. **initCodeHash()**: Returns the initialization code hash of the proxy.
   - Used for mining vanity addresses with `create2`.

3. **_initCode()**: Returns a pointer to the initialization code of a proxy created via this factory.
   - Contains the creation and runtime bytecode for the proxy.

4. **_emptyData()**: Helper function to return an empty bytes calldata.
   - Uses inline assembly to set the length of the data to zero.

### Summary
The `ERC1967Factory` contract provides functionalities to:
- Deploy new ERC1967 proxy contracts.
- Upgrade the implementation of existing proxies.
- Change the admin of proxies.
- Predict the address of proxies deployed with a deterministic salt.
- Emit events for admin changes, upgrades, and deployments.
- Handle errors and revert conditions appropriately.
