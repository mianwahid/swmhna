To ensure the robustness and correctness of the `Initializable` contract, we need to define test invariants that cover various edge cases for each functionality. Here are the test invariants for the `Initializable` contract:

### 1. Initialization Invariants

#### 1.1 Initializer Modifier
- **Invariant 1.1.1**: The `initializer` modifier should only allow the function to be called once.
  - **Test Case**: Call a function with the `initializer` modifier twice. The second call should revert with `InvalidInitialization`.
- **Invariant 1.1.2**: The `initializer` modifier should set the `initializing` flag to 1 during execution and reset it to 0 after execution.
  - **Test Case**: Check the `initializing` flag before, during, and after the execution of a function with the `initializer` modifier.
- **Invariant 1.1.3**: The `initializer` modifier should set the `initializedVersion` to 1 after execution.
  - **Test Case**: Check the `initializedVersion` before and after the execution of a function with the `initializer` modifier.

#### 1.2 Reinitializer Modifier
- **Invariant 1.2.1**: The `reinitializer` modifier should only allow the function to be called once per version.
  - **Test Case**: Call a function with the `reinitializer` modifier twice with the same version. The second call should revert with `InvalidInitialization`.
- **Invariant 1.2.2**: The `reinitializer` modifier should set the `initializing` flag to 1 during execution and reset it to 0 after execution.
  - **Test Case**: Check the `initializing` flag before, during, and after the execution of a function with the `reinitializer` modifier.
- **Invariant 1.2.3**: The `reinitializer` modifier should set the `initializedVersion` to the provided version after execution.
  - **Test Case**: Check the `initializedVersion` before and after the execution of a function with the `reinitializer` modifier.

### 2. Only Initializing Invariants

#### 2.1 Only Initializing Modifier
- **Invariant 2.1.1**: The `onlyInitializing` modifier should only allow the function to be called during the initialization process.
  - **Test Case**: Call a function with the `onlyInitializing` modifier outside of the initialization process. The call should revert with `NotInitializing`.

### 3. Disable Initializers Invariants

#### 3.1 Disable Initializers Function
- **Invariant 3.1.1**: The `_disableInitializers` function should set the `initializedVersion` to `2**64 - 1`.
  - **Test Case**: Call the `_disableInitializers` function and check the `initializedVersion` after execution.
- **Invariant 3.1.2**: The `_disableInitializers` function should emit the `Initialized` event with the version `2**64 - 1` the first time it is called.
  - **Test Case**: Call the `_disableInitializers` function and check the emitted event.

### 4. Getters Invariants

#### 4.1 Get Initialized Version Function
- **Invariant 4.1.1**: The `_getInitializedVersion` function should return the correct `initializedVersion`.
  - **Test Case**: Call the `_getInitializedVersion` function and compare the returned value with the expected `initializedVersion`.

#### 4.2 Is Initializing Function
- **Invariant 4.2.1**: The `_isInitializing` function should return the correct `initializing` flag.
  - **Test Case**: Call the `_isInitializing` function and compare the returned value with the expected `initializing` flag.

### 5. Storage Slot Invariants

#### 5.1 Initializable Slot Function
- **Invariant 5.1.1**: The `_initializableSlot` function should return the correct storage slot.
  - **Test Case**: Call the `_initializableSlot` function and compare the returned value with the expected `_INITIALIZABLE_SLOT`.

### Summary
These test invariants ensure that the `Initializable` contract behaves correctly under various conditions, including edge cases. By covering initialization, reinitialization, only initializing, disabling initializers, getters, and storage slot functionalities, we can verify the robustness and correctness of the contract.
