The provided smart contract, `ERC1967Factory`, is a factory contract for deploying and managing ERC1967 proxy contracts. Below is a detailed explanation of its functionalities:

### Custom Errors
1. **Unauthorized**: Thrown when the caller is not authorized to call a function.
2. **DeploymentFailed**: Thrown when the proxy deployment fails.
3. **UpgradeFailed**: Thrown when the upgrade of the proxy fails.
4. **SaltDoesNotStartWithCaller**: Thrown when the provided salt does not start with the caller's address.

### Events
1. **AdminChanged**: Emitted when the admin of a proxy contract is changed.
   - Parameters: `proxy` (address of the proxy), `admin` (new admin address).
2. **Upgraded**: Emitted when the implementation of a proxy is upgraded.
   - Parameters: `proxy` (address of the proxy), `implementation` (new implementation address).
3. **Deployed**: Emitted when a new proxy is deployed.
   - Parameters: `proxy` (address of the proxy), `implementation` (implementation address), `admin` (admin address).

### Storage Constants
1. **_IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT**: The storage slot for the implementation in the proxy, calculated as `uint256(keccak256("eip1967.proxy.implementation")) - 1`.

### Admin Functions
1. **adminOf(address proxy)**: Returns the admin of the specified proxy.
   - Uses inline assembly to load the admin from storage.
2. **changeAdmin(address proxy, address admin)**: Sets the admin of the specified proxy.
   - Checks if the caller is the current admin of the proxy.
   - Updates the admin in storage and emits the `AdminChanged` event.

### Upgrade Functions
1. **upgrade(address proxy, address implementation)**: Upgrades the proxy to point to a new implementation.
   - Calls `upgradeAndCall` with empty data.
2. **upgradeAndCall(address proxy, address implementation, bytes calldata data)**: Upgrades the proxy to a new implementation and calls the proxy with the provided data.
   - Checks if the caller is the current admin of the proxy.
   - Sets up the calldata to upgrade the proxy and calls the proxy.
   - Emits the `Upgraded` event.

### Deploy Functions
1. **deploy(address implementation, address admin)**: Deploys a proxy for the specified implementation and admin, and returns its address.
   - Calls `deployAndCall` with empty data.
2. **deployAndCall(address implementation, address admin, bytes calldata data)**: Deploys a proxy for the specified implementation and admin, and calls the proxy with the provided data.
   - Calls `_deploy` with the provided parameters.
3. **deployDeterministic(address implementation, address admin, bytes32 salt)**: Deploys a proxy deterministically using the provided salt and returns its address.
   - Calls `deployDeterministicAndCall` with empty data.
4. **deployDeterministicAndCall(address implementation, address admin, bytes32 salt, bytes calldata data)**: Deploys a proxy deterministically using the provided salt and calls the proxy with the provided data.
   - Checks if the salt starts with the zero address or the caller's address.
   - Calls `_deploy` with the provided parameters.

### Internal Deploy Function
1. **_deploy(address implementation, address admin, bytes32 salt, bool useSalt, bytes calldata data)**: Deploys the proxy, with optionality to deploy deterministically with a salt.
   - Uses inline assembly to create the proxy using `create` or `create2`.
   - Sets the implementation and admin of the proxy.
   - Emits the `Deployed` event.

### Utility Functions
1. **predictDeterministicAddress(bytes32 salt)**: Returns the address of the proxy deployed with the specified salt.
   - Computes the address using the `create2` address derivation formula.
2. **initCodeHash()**: Returns the initialization code hash of the proxy.
   - Uses inline assembly to compute the keccak256 hash of the initialization code.
3. **_initCode()**: Returns a pointer to the initialization code of a proxy created via this factory.
   - Uses inline assembly to construct the initialization code for the proxy.
4. **_emptyData()**: Helper function to return an empty bytes calldata.
   - Uses inline assembly to set the length of the data to zero.

### Summary
The `ERC1967Factory` contract provides a comprehensive set of functionalities for deploying, managing, and upgrading ERC1967 proxy contracts. It includes custom error handling, event logging, and utility functions to facilitate deterministic deployments and address predictions. The contract leverages inline assembly for efficient storage access and proxy creation.
