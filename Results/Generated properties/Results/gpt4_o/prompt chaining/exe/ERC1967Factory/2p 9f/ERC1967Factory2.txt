To ensure the robustness and correctness of the `ERC1967Factory` smart contract, we need to define a set of test invariants. These invariants will help us verify that the contract behaves as expected under various conditions, including edge cases. Below are the test invariants for each functionality of the contract:

### Admin Functions

1. **Invariant: `adminOf` should return the correct admin address**
   - **Edge Cases**:
     - Querying the admin of a proxy that has not been deployed.
     - Querying the admin of a proxy after it has been changed.

2. **Invariant: Only the current admin can change the admin of a proxy**
   - **Edge Cases**:
     - Attempting to change the admin by a non-admin address.
     - Changing the admin to the zero address.
     - Changing the admin to the same address (no-op).

### Upgrade Functions

3. **Invariant: Only the current admin can upgrade the proxy**
   - **Edge Cases**:
     - Attempting to upgrade the proxy by a non-admin address.
     - Upgrading the proxy to the zero address.
     - Upgrading the proxy to the same implementation address (no-op).

4. **Invariant: `upgradeAndCall` should correctly upgrade and call the proxy**
   - **Edge Cases**:
     - Providing empty data for the call.
     - Providing invalid data for the call.
     - Ensuring the call reverts if the upgrade fails.

### Deploy Functions

5. **Invariant: `deploy` should correctly deploy a proxy**
   - **Edge Cases**:
     - Deploying with the zero address as the implementation.
     - Deploying with the zero address as the admin.
     - Deploying with a non-zero value (ETH) sent to the function.

6. **Invariant: `deployAndCall` should correctly deploy and call the proxy**
   - **Edge Cases**:
     - Providing empty data for the call.
     - Providing invalid data for the call.
     - Ensuring the call reverts if the deployment fails.

7. **Invariant: `deployDeterministic` should correctly deploy a proxy deterministically**
   - **Edge Cases**:
     - Deploying with the zero address as the implementation.
     - Deploying with the zero address as the admin.
     - Deploying with a salt that does not start with the caller's address.
     - Deploying with a non-zero value (ETH) sent to the function.

8. **Invariant: `deployDeterministicAndCall` should correctly deploy and call the proxy deterministically**
   - **Edge Cases**:
     - Providing empty data for the call.
     - Providing invalid data for the call.
     - Ensuring the call reverts if the deployment fails.
     - Deploying with a salt that does not start with the caller's address.

### Utility Functions

9. **Invariant: `predictDeterministicAddress` should return the correct address**
   - **Edge Cases**:
     - Predicting the address with a zero salt.
     - Predicting the address with a salt that starts with the caller's address.
     - Predicting the address with a salt that does not start with the caller's address.

10. **Invariant: `initCodeHash` should return the correct initialization code hash**
    - **Edge Cases**:
      - Verifying the hash against a known correct value.
      - Ensuring the hash remains consistent across multiple calls.

### General Invariants

11. **Invariant: Events should be emitted correctly**
    - **Edge Cases**:
      - Ensuring `AdminChanged` is emitted with the correct parameters.
      - Ensuring `Upgraded` is emitted with the correct parameters.
      - Ensuring `Deployed` is emitted with the correct parameters.

12. **Invariant: Custom errors should be thrown correctly**
    - **Edge Cases**:
      - Ensuring `Unauthorized` is thrown when a non-admin attempts to change the admin or upgrade the proxy.
      - Ensuring `DeploymentFailed` is thrown when the proxy deployment fails.
      - Ensuring `UpgradeFailed` is thrown when the proxy upgrade fails.
      - Ensuring `SaltDoesNotStartWithCaller` is thrown when the provided salt does not start with the caller's address.

By testing these invariants, we can ensure that the `ERC1967Factory` contract behaves correctly under various conditions and edge cases, providing a robust and reliable implementation for deploying and managing ERC1967 proxy contracts.
