The provided smart contract is a Solidity library named `LibZip` that offers functionalities for compressing and decompressing data using two different methods: FastLZ and selective run-length encoding (RLE) for calldata. Below is a detailed explanation of each functionality:

### FastLZ Operations

#### 1. `flzCompress`
```solidity
function flzCompress(bytes memory data) internal pure returns (bytes memory result)
```
- **Purpose**: Compresses the input data using the FastLZ algorithm.
- **Details**:
  - The function uses inline assembly to perform the compression.
  - It initializes a hashmap and iterates through the input data to find matches and literals.
  - Matches are encoded using a specific format, and literals are copied directly.
  - The result is a compressed byte array stored in memory.

#### 2. `flzDecompress`
```solidity
function flzDecompress(bytes memory data) internal pure returns (bytes memory result)
```
- **Purpose**: Decompresses the input data that was compressed using the FastLZ algorithm.
- **Details**:
  - The function uses inline assembly to perform the decompression.
  - It reads the compressed data and reconstructs the original data by decoding matches and literals.
  - The result is a decompressed byte array stored in memory.

### Calldata Operations

#### 3. `cdCompress`
```solidity
function cdCompress(bytes memory data) internal pure returns (bytes memory result)
```
- **Purpose**: Compresses the input data using selective run-length encoding (RLE) for calldata.
- **Details**:
  - The function uses inline assembly to perform the compression.
  - It identifies sequences of consecutive `0x00` and `0xff` bytes and encodes them using a control byte.
  - The first 4 bytes of the compressed data are bitwise negated to allow dispatching into the `fallback` and `receive` functions.
  - The result is a compressed byte array stored in memory.

#### 4. `cdDecompress`
```solidity
function cdDecompress(bytes memory data) internal pure returns (bytes memory result)
```
- **Purpose**: Decompresses the input data that was compressed using the selective RLE method.
- **Details**:
  - The function uses inline assembly to perform the decompression.
  - It reads the compressed data, negates the first 4 bytes, and reconstructs the original data by decoding the control bytes.
  - The result is a decompressed byte array stored in memory.

#### 5. `cdFallback`
```solidity
function cdFallback() internal
```
- **Purpose**: To be called in the `fallback` function of a contract to handle compressed calldata.
- **Details**:
  - The function uses inline assembly to decompress the calldata.
  - It negates the first 4 bytes and processes the calldata to reconstruct the original data.
  - The decompressed data is then used to perform a `delegatecall` to the current contract address.
  - If the `delegatecall` fails, it reverts with the returned data.

### Usage Example
To use the `cdFallback` function in a contract, you would define the `fallback` and `receive` functions as follows:
```solidity
fallback() external payable { LibZip.cdFallback(); }
receive() external payable {} // Silence compiler warning to add a `receive` function.
```

### Summary
- **FastLZ Operations**: Provides `flzCompress` and `flzDecompress` functions for compressing and decompressing data using the FastLZ algorithm.
- **Calldata Operations**: Provides `cdCompress` and `cdDecompress` functions for compressing and decompressing calldata using selective RLE. The `cdFallback` function is used to handle compressed calldata in the `fallback` function of a contract.

These functionalities are useful for reducing the size of data stored on-chain or transmitted via calldata, potentially saving gas costs.
