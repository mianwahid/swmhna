To create test invariants for the `GasBurnerLib` smart contract, we need to ensure that the `burn` function behaves as expected under various conditions. Here are the test invariants that cover specific edge cases for the `burn` function:

### Test Invariants

1. **Invariant: Gas Consumption**
   - **Description**: Ensure that the function consumes a predictable amount of gas based on the input `x`.
   - **Edge Cases**:
     - `x = 0`: The function should consume minimal gas.
     - `x = 1`: The function should consume a small amount of gas.
     - `x = 120`: The function should consume gas but not enter the loop.
     - `x = 121`: The function should start entering the loop.
     - `x = 1000`: The function should consume a significant amount of gas.

2. **Invariant: Memory Manipulation**
   - **Description**: Ensure that the memory at location `0x10` is manipulated correctly.
   - **Edge Cases**:
     - `x = 0`: The memory should be set to `1`.
     - `x = 1`: The memory should be set to `1 | 1 = 1`.
     - `x = 120`: The memory should be set to `1 | 120 = 121`.
     - `x = 121`: The memory should be set to `1 | 121 = 121`.
     - `x = 1000`: The memory should be set to `1 | 1000 = 1001`.

3. **Invariant: Loop Execution**
   - **Description**: Ensure that the loop executes the correct number of times.
   - **Edge Cases**:
     - `x = 0`: The loop should not execute.
     - `x = 120`: The loop should not execute.
     - `x = 121`: The loop should execute `121 / 91 = 1` time.
     - `x = 182`: The loop should execute `182 / 91 = 2` times.
     - `x = 1000`: The loop should execute `1000 / 91 â‰ˆ 10` times.

4. **Invariant: Invalid Opcode Execution**
   - **Description**: Ensure that the `invalid()` opcode is executed correctly when the memory at `0x10` is zero.
   - **Edge Cases**:
     - `x = 0`: The memory should not be zero, so `invalid()` should not be executed.
     - `x = 1`: The memory should not be zero, so `invalid()` should not be executed.
     - `x = 120`: The memory should not be zero, so `invalid()` should not be executed.
     - `x = 121`: The memory should not be zero, so `invalid()` should not be executed.
     - `x = 1000`: The memory should not be zero, so `invalid()` should not be executed.

5. **Invariant: No Reversion on Valid Input**
   - **Description**: Ensure that the function does not revert for valid inputs.
   - **Edge Cases**:
     - `x = 0`: The function should not revert.
     - `x = 1`: The function should not revert.
     - `x = 120`: The function should not revert.
     - `x = 121`: The function should not revert.
     - `x = 1000`: The function should not revert.

6. **Invariant: Reversion on Invalid Memory State**
   - **Description**: Ensure that the function reverts if the memory at `0x10` is zero after the loop.
   - **Edge Cases**:
     - Modify the function to force `mstore(0x10, 0)` after the loop and ensure it reverts.

### Summary
These test invariants cover the critical aspects of the `burn` function, including gas consumption, memory manipulation, loop execution, and the correct handling of the `invalid()` opcode. By testing these invariants, we can ensure that the `GasBurnerLib` library functions as intended under various conditions.
