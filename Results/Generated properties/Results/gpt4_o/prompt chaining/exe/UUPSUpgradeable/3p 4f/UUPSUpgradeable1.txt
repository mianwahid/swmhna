The provided smart contract is an abstract contract named `UUPSUpgradeable`, which is designed to facilitate the upgradeability of smart contracts using the UUPS (Universal Upgradeable Proxy Standard) pattern. This contract is intended to be used with ERC1967 proxies. Below is a detailed explanation of each functionality within the contract:

### Custom Errors
1. **`UpgradeFailed`**:
   - This error is thrown when the upgrade process fails.

2. **`UnauthorizedCallContext`**:
   - This error is thrown when a function is called from an unauthorized context, such as when a function that should only be called via a proxy is called directly.

### Immutables
3. **`__self`**:
   - This immutable variable stores the address of the contract itself. It is used to check if the context of the call is a delegate call.

### Events
4. **`Upgraded`**:
   - This event is emitted when the proxy's implementation is successfully upgraded. It includes the address of the new implementation.

5. **`_UPGRADED_EVENT_SIGNATURE`**:
   - This constant stores the `keccak256` hash of the `Upgraded(address)` event signature. It is used in the assembly code to log the event.

### Storage
6. **`_ERC1967_IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT`**:
   - This constant defines the storage slot used by the implementation in the proxy, as specified by ERC1967. It is calculated as `uint256(keccak256("eip1967.proxy.implementation")) - 1`.

### UUPS Operations
7. **`_authorizeUpgrade`**:
   - This is an abstract function that must be overridden in derived contracts. It is used to check if the `msg.sender` is authorized to upgrade the proxy to `newImplementation`. If not authorized, it should revert.

8. **`proxiableUUID`**:
   - This function returns the storage slot used by the implementation, complying with ERC1822. It uses the `notDelegated` modifier to ensure it is not called via a delegate call.

9. **`upgradeToAndCall`**:
   - This function upgrades the proxy's implementation to `newImplementation` and optionally calls a function on the new implementation with the provided `data`.
   - It first calls `_authorizeUpgrade` to check if the upgrade is authorized.
   - It then uses assembly code to:
     - Ensure the new implementation correctly implements `proxiableUUID`.
     - Emit the `Upgraded` event.
     - Update the implementation in the storage slot.
     - Perform a delegate call to the new implementation if `data` is non-empty.

### Modifiers
10. **`onlyProxy`**:
    - This modifier ensures that the function it modifies is only called through a proxy. It checks if the current context is a delegate call by comparing the contract's address with `__self`.

11. **`notDelegated`**:
    - This modifier ensures that the function it modifies is not called via a delegate call. It is the opposite of `onlyProxy` and checks if the current context is not a delegate call.

### Summary
The `UUPSUpgradeable` contract provides a framework for upgrading smart contracts using the UUPS pattern. It includes mechanisms for:
- Authorizing upgrades.
- Ensuring upgrades are performed correctly.
- Emitting events when upgrades occur.
- Protecting functions from being called in the wrong context (either directly or via delegate call).

To use this contract, a developer would need to inherit from it and implement the `_authorizeUpgrade` function to define the authorization logic for upgrades.
