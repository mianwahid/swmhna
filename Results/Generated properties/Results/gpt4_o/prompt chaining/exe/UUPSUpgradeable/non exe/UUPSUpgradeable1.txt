The provided smart contract is an abstract contract named `UUPSUpgradeable`, which is designed to facilitate the upgradeability of smart contracts using the UUPS (Universal Upgradeable Proxy Standard) pattern. This contract is intended to be used with ERC1967 proxies. Below is a detailed explanation of each functionality within the contract:

### Custom Errors
1. **`UpgradeFailed`**: This error is thrown when the upgrade process fails.
2. **`UnauthorizedCallContext`**: This error is thrown when a function is called from an unauthorized context.

### Immutables
1. **`__self`**: This immutable variable stores the address of the contract itself. It is used to check if the context of the call is a delegate call.

### Events
1. **`Upgraded`**: This event is emitted when the proxy's implementation is upgraded. It includes the address of the new implementation.
2. **`_UPGRADED_EVENT_SIGNATURE`**: This constant stores the `keccak256` hash of the `Upgraded` event signature. It is used in the assembly code to log the event.

### Storage
1. **`_ERC1967_IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT`**: This constant defines the storage slot used by the implementation in the proxy. It is calculated as `uint256(keccak256("eip1967.proxy.implementation")) - 1`.

### UUPS Operations
1. **`_authorizeUpgrade`**: This is an abstract function that must be overridden in derived contracts. It should contain the logic to check if `msg.sender` is authorized to upgrade the proxy to `newImplementation`. If not authorized, it should revert.
   ```solidity
   function _authorizeUpgrade(address newImplementation) internal virtual;
   ```

2. **`proxiableUUID`**: This function returns the storage slot used by the implementation, complying with ERC1822. It uses the `notDelegated` modifier to ensure it is not called via delegatecall.
   ```solidity
   function proxiableUUID() public view virtual notDelegated returns (bytes32) {
       return _ERC1967_IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT;
   }
   ```

3. **`upgradeToAndCall`**: This function upgrades the proxy's implementation to `newImplementation` and optionally calls a function on the new implementation with the provided `data`. It emits the `Upgraded` event. The function uses the `onlyProxy` modifier to ensure it is called through a proxy.
   ```solidity
   function upgradeToAndCall(address newImplementation, bytes calldata data)
       public
       payable
       virtual
       onlyProxy
   {
       _authorizeUpgrade(newImplementation);
       // Assembly code to perform the upgrade and optional delegatecall
   }
   ```

### Modifiers
1. **`onlyProxy`**: This modifier ensures that the function is called through a proxy. It checks if the context is a delegate call by comparing the contract's address with the stored `__self` address.
   ```solidity
   modifier onlyProxy() {
       uint256 s = __self;
       assembly {
           if eq(s, address()) {
               mstore(0x00, 0x9f03a026) // `UnauthorizedCallContext()`.
               revert(0x1c, 0x04)
           }
       }
       _;
   }
   ```

2. **`notDelegated`**: This modifier ensures that the function is not called via delegatecall. It is the opposite of `onlyProxy`.
   ```solidity
   modifier notDelegated() {
       uint256 s = __self;
       assembly {
           if iszero(eq(s, address())) {
               mstore(0x00, 0x9f03a026) // `UnauthorizedCallContext()`.
               revert(0x1c, 0x04)
           }
       }
       _;
   }
   ```

### Assembly Code in `upgradeToAndCall`
- **Clearing Upper 96 Bits**: The upper 96 bits of `newImplementation` are cleared to ensure it is a valid address.
- **Checking `proxiableUUID`**: The function checks if `newImplementation` correctly implements `proxiableUUID` by comparing the returned value with `_ERC1967_IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT`.
- **Emitting `Upgraded` Event**: The `Upgraded` event is emitted using the `log2` assembly instruction.
- **Updating Implementation**: The implementation address in the storage slot is updated to `newImplementation`.
- **Optional Delegatecall**: If `data` is non-empty, a delegatecall is made to `newImplementation` with the provided `data`.

This contract provides a robust framework for upgrading smart contracts using the UUPS pattern, ensuring that only authorized users can perform upgrades and that the new implementation is correctly set up.
