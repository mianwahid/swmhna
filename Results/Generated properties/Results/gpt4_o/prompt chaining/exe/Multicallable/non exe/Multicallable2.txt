To ensure the `Multicallable` contract functions correctly and securely, we need to define a set of test invariants. These invariants will help us verify that the contract behaves as expected under various conditions, including edge cases. Here are the test invariants for the `Multicallable` contract:

### Test Invariants

1. **Empty Data Array**:
   - **Invariant**: When the `data` array is empty, the function should return an empty array.
   - **Edge Case**: Call `multicall` with an empty `data` array.

2. **Single Call Success**:
   - **Invariant**: When the `data` array contains a single valid call, the function should return the result of that call.
   - **Edge Case**: Call `multicall` with a single valid method call in the `data` array.

3. **Multiple Calls Success**:
   - **Invariant**: When the `data` array contains multiple valid calls, the function should return the results of all calls in the correct order.
   - **Edge Case**: Call `multicall` with multiple valid method calls in the `data` array.

4. **Single Call Revert**:
   - **Invariant**: When the `data` array contains a single call that reverts, the entire transaction should revert.
   - **Edge Case**: Call `multicall` with a single method call that is designed to revert.

5. **Multiple Calls with One Revert**:
   - **Invariant**: When the `data` array contains multiple calls and at least one call reverts, the entire transaction should revert.
   - **Edge Case**: Call `multicall` with multiple method calls where one of the calls is designed to revert.

6. **Gas Consumption**:
   - **Invariant**: The gas consumption should be within expected limits for a given number of calls.
   - **Edge Case**: Measure gas consumption for varying numbers of method calls in the `data` array.

7. **Return Data Size Alignment**:
   - **Invariant**: The return data size should be correctly aligned to the next multiple of 32 bytes.
   - **Edge Case**: Call `multicall` with method calls that return data of various sizes.

8. **Non-Payable Function**:
   - **Invariant**: The function should revert if called with any ether.
   - **Edge Case**: Attempt to call `multicall` with ether.

9. **Delegatecall Context**:
   - **Invariant**: The `DELEGATECALL` should execute in the context of the calling contract, preserving its state and storage.
   - **Edge Case**: Call `multicall` with method calls that modify the state of the contract and verify the state changes.

10. **Revert Data Propagation**:
    - **Invariant**: If a `DELEGATECALL` reverts, the revert data should be correctly propagated and the entire transaction should revert.
    - **Edge Case**: Call `multicall` with a method call that reverts with specific revert data and verify the revert data is propagated.

11. **Memory Management**:
    - **Invariant**: The memory used for storing results should be correctly managed and freed after execution.
    - **Edge Case**: Call `multicall` with a large number of method calls and verify memory usage.

12. **Calldata Copying**:
    - **Invariant**: The calldata should be correctly copied to memory for each method call.
    - **Edge Case**: Call `multicall` with method calls that have varying calldata sizes and verify the calldata is correctly copied.

### Summary
These test invariants cover a wide range of scenarios, including normal operation, edge cases, and potential vulnerabilities. By implementing tests based on these invariants, we can ensure that the `Multicallable` contract behaves as expected and is robust against various edge cases and potential issues.
