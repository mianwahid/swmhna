To ensure the correctness and robustness of the `LibRLP` library, we need to define a set of test invariants that cover various edge cases. These invariants will help us verify that the `computeAddress` function behaves as expected under different conditions. Here are the test invariants for the `computeAddress` function:

### Test Invariants

1. **Invariant for Zero Nonce:**
   - **Description:** Verify that the function correctly computes the address when the nonce is zero.
   - **Edge Case:** Nonce is zero.
   - **Test:** 
     ```solidity
     address deployer = 0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890;
     uint256 nonce = 0;
     address expectedAddress = /* precomputed expected address */;
     assert(LibRLP.computeAddress(deployer, nonce) == expectedAddress);
     ```

2. **Invariant for Small Nonce (<= 127):**
   - **Description:** Verify that the function correctly computes the address for small nonces.
   - **Edge Case:** Nonce is a small value (e.g., 1, 127).
   - **Test:**
     ```solidity
     address deployer = 0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890;
     uint256 nonce = 1;
     address expectedAddress = /* precomputed expected address */;
     assert(LibRLP.computeAddress(deployer, nonce) == expectedAddress);

     nonce = 127;
     expectedAddress = /* precomputed expected address */;
     assert(LibRLP.computeAddress(deployer, nonce) == expectedAddress);
     ```

3. **Invariant for Large Nonce (> 127):**
   - **Description:** Verify that the function correctly computes the address for large nonces.
   - **Edge Case:** Nonce is a large value (e.g., 128, 1024).
   - **Test:**
     ```solidity
     address deployer = 0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890;
     uint256 nonce = 128;
     address expectedAddress = /* precomputed expected address */;
     assert(LibRLP.computeAddress(deployer, nonce) == expectedAddress);

     nonce = 1024;
     expectedAddress = /* precomputed expected address */;
     assert(LibRLP.computeAddress(deployer, nonce) == expectedAddress);
     ```

4. **Invariant for Maximum Nonce (2**64 - 2):**
   - **Description:** Verify that the function correctly computes the address for the maximum allowed nonce.
   - **Edge Case:** Nonce is at its maximum value (2**64 - 2).
   - **Test:**
     ```solidity
     address deployer = 0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890;
     uint256 nonce = 2**64 - 2;
     address expectedAddress = /* precomputed expected address */;
     assert(LibRLP.computeAddress(deployer, nonce) == expectedAddress);
     ```

5. **Invariant for Different Deployer Addresses:**
   - **Description:** Verify that the function correctly computes the address for different deployer addresses.
   - **Edge Case:** Different deployer addresses with the same nonce.
   - **Test:**
     ```solidity
     address deployer1 = 0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890;
     address deployer2 = 0x0987654321098765432109876543210987654321;
     uint256 nonce = 1;
     address expectedAddress1 = /* precomputed expected address for deployer1 */;
     address expectedAddress2 = /* precomputed expected address for deployer2 */;
     assert(LibRLP.computeAddress(deployer1, nonce) == expectedAddress1);
     assert(LibRLP.computeAddress(deployer2, nonce) == expectedAddress2);
     ```

6. **Invariant for Edge Case Nonces (e.g., 255, 256):**
   - **Description:** Verify that the function correctly computes the address for edge case nonces.
   - **Edge Case:** Nonces like 255 and 256.
   - **Test:**
     ```solidity
     address deployer = 0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890;
     uint256 nonce = 255;
     address expectedAddress = /* precomputed expected address */;
     assert(LibRLP.computeAddress(deployer, nonce) == expectedAddress);

     nonce = 256;
     expectedAddress = /* precomputed expected address */;
     assert(LibRLP.computeAddress(deployer, nonce) == expectedAddress);
     ```

7. **Invariant for Nonce with High Bits Set:**
   - **Description:** Verify that the function correctly computes the address for nonces with high bits set.
   - **Edge Case:** Nonces with high bits set (e.g., 2**63).
   - **Test:**
     ```solidity
     address deployer = 0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890;
     uint256 nonce = 2**63;
     address expectedAddress = /* precomputed expected address */;
     assert(LibRLP.computeAddress(deployer, nonce) == expectedAddress);
     ```

8. **Invariant for Nonce with Low Bits Set:**
   - **Description:** Verify that the function correctly computes the address for nonces with low bits set.
   - **Edge Case:** Nonces with low bits set (e.g., 1, 3, 7).
   - **Test:**
     ```solidity
     address deployer = 0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890;
     uint256 nonce = 1;
     address expectedAddress = /* precomputed expected address */;
     assert(LibRLP.computeAddress(deployer, nonce) == expectedAddress);

     nonce = 3;
     expectedAddress = /* precomputed expected address */;
     assert(LibRLP.computeAddress(deployer, nonce) == expectedAddress);

     nonce = 7;
     expectedAddress = /* precomputed expected address */;
     assert(LibRLP.computeAddress(deployer, nonce) == expectedAddress);
     ```

### Summary
These test invariants cover a wide range of edge cases for the `computeAddress` function, ensuring that it behaves correctly for different deployer addresses and nonce values. By implementing these tests, we can verify the correctness and robustness of the `LibRLP` library.
