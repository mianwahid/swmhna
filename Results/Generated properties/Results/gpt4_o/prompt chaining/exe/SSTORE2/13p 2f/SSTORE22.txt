To ensure the correctness and robustness of the `SSTORE2` library, we need to write test invariants that cover all functionalities and edge cases. Here are the test invariants for each function:

### Invariants for `write` Function

1. **Successful Deployment**
   - Ensure that the function returns a valid contract address.
   - Verify that the deployed contract contains the correct data prefixed with a STOP opcode.

2. **Deployment Failure**
   - Test with data that exceeds the maximum contract size (24,576 bytes) to ensure it reverts with `DeploymentFailed`.

### Invariants for `writeDeterministic` Function

1. **Successful Deterministic Deployment**
   - Ensure that the function returns a valid contract address.
   - Verify that the deployed contract contains the correct data prefixed with a STOP opcode.
   - Ensure that the address is deterministic based on the provided salt and deployer address.

2. **Deployment Failure**
   - Test with data that exceeds the maximum contract size (24,576 bytes) to ensure it reverts with `DeploymentFailed`.

### Invariants for `initCodeHash` Function

1. **Correct Hash Calculation**
   - Verify that the function returns the correct initialization code hash for given data.
   - Ensure that the hash is consistent for the same input data.

### Invariants for `predictDeterministicAddress` Function

1. **Correct Address Prediction**
   - Verify that the function returns the correct deterministic address for given data, salt, and deployer address.
   - Ensure that the predicted address matches the actual deployed address when using `writeDeterministic`.

### Invariants for `read` Function

1. **Valid Pointer**
   - Ensure that the function returns the correct data stored in the contract.
   - Verify that the data is correctly prefixed with a STOP opcode.

2. **Invalid Pointer**
   - Test with an invalid contract address to ensure it reverts with `InvalidPointer`.

### Invariants for `read` Function (with start)

1. **Valid Pointer and Start**
   - Ensure that the function returns the correct data starting from the specified byte.
   - Verify that the data is correctly prefixed with a STOP opcode.

2. **Invalid Pointer**
   - Test with an invalid contract address to ensure it reverts with `InvalidPointer`.

3. **Out of Bounds Start**
   - Test with a start position that exceeds the data length to ensure it reverts with `ReadOutOfBounds`.

### Invariants for `read` Function (with start and end)

1. **Valid Pointer, Start, and End**
   - Ensure that the function returns the correct data from the specified start to end bytes.
   - Verify that the data is correctly prefixed with a STOP opcode.

2. **Invalid Pointer**
   - Test with an invalid contract address to ensure it reverts with `InvalidPointer`.

3. **Out of Bounds Start or End**
   - Test with start or end positions that exceed the data length to ensure it reverts with `ReadOutOfBounds`.
   - Test with start greater than end to ensure it reverts with `ReadOutOfBounds`.

### Summary of Test Invariants

1. **write Function**
   - Valid data deployment.
   - Data exceeding maximum contract size.

2. **writeDeterministic Function**
   - Valid deterministic data deployment.
   - Data exceeding maximum contract size.

3. **initCodeHash Function**
   - Correct hash calculation for given data.

4. **predictDeterministicAddress Function**
   - Correct address prediction for given data, salt, and deployer.

5. **read Function**
   - Valid pointer.
   - Invalid pointer.

6. **read Function (with start)**
   - Valid pointer and start.
   - Invalid pointer.
   - Out of bounds start.

7. **read Function (with start and end)**
   - Valid pointer, start, and end.
   - Invalid pointer.
   - Out of bounds start or end.
   - Start greater than end.

By covering these invariants, we can ensure that the `SSTORE2` library functions correctly under various scenarios and edge cases.
