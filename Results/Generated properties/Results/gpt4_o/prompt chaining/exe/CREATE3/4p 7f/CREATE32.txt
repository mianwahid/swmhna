To ensure the robustness and correctness of the `CREATE3` library, we need to define a set of test invariants that cover various edge cases for each functionality provided by the contract. Here are the test invariants for the `CREATE3` library:

### Invariants for `deploy` Function

1. **Successful Deployment**:
   - **Invariant**: The function should successfully deploy a contract when provided with valid `salt`, `creationCode`, and `value`.
   - **Edge Cases**:
     - Deploy with zero `value`.
     - Deploy with non-zero `value`.
     - Deploy with minimal `creationCode` (e.g., a contract that does nothing).
     - Deploy with complex `creationCode` (e.g., a contract with multiple functions and storage variables).

2. **Deployment Failure**:
   - **Invariant**: The function should revert with `DeploymentFailed` if the proxy contract deployment fails.
   - **Edge Cases**:
     - Use a `salt` that causes `create2` to fail (e.g., a salt that results in an address collision).

3. **Initialization Failure**:
   - **Invariant**: The function should revert with `InitializationFailed` if the initialization of the deployed contract fails.
   - **Edge Cases**:
     - Provide `creationCode` that reverts during initialization.
     - Provide `creationCode` that consumes all gas during initialization.

4. **Zero Code Size**:
   - **Invariant**: The function should revert with `InitializationFailed` if the deployed contract has zero code size.
   - **Edge Cases**:
     - Provide `creationCode` that results in a contract with zero code size.

5. **Deterministic Address Calculation**:
   - **Invariant**: The function should return the correct deterministic address for the deployed contract.
   - **Edge Cases**:
     - Verify the address for different `salt` values.
     - Verify the address for different `creationCode` values.
     - Verify the address for different `value` values.

### Invariants for `getDeployed` Function (with deployer parameter)

1. **Correct Address Calculation**:
   - **Invariant**: The function should return the correct deterministic address for a given `salt` and `deployer`.
   - **Edge Cases**:
     - Verify the address for different `salt` values.
     - Verify the address for different `deployer` addresses.
     - Verify the address for different combinations of `salt` and `deployer`.

### Invariants for `getDeployed` Function (without deployer parameter)

1. **Correct Address Calculation**:
   - **Invariant**: The function should return the correct deterministic address for a given `salt` using the current contract's address as the deployer.
   - **Edge Cases**:
     - Verify the address for different `salt` values.
     - Verify the address when the current contract's address changes (e.g., through a proxy or upgradeable contract).

### General Invariants

1. **Gas Consumption**:
   - **Invariant**: The functions should not consume excessive gas.
   - **Edge Cases**:
     - Measure gas consumption for minimal `creationCode`.
     - Measure gas consumption for complex `creationCode`.
     - Measure gas consumption for different `salt` values.

2. **Reentrancy**:
   - **Invariant**: The functions should be resistant to reentrancy attacks.
   - **Edge Cases**:
     - Attempt reentrancy during the `deploy` function.
     - Attempt reentrancy during the `getDeployed` functions.

3. **State Preservation**:
   - **Invariant**: The functions should not alter the state of the contract or the blockchain unexpectedly.
   - **Edge Cases**:
     - Verify that no state variables are modified.
     - Verify that no unexpected ETH transfers occur.

By covering these invariants and edge cases, we can ensure that the `CREATE3` library functions correctly and securely under various conditions.
