## Test Invariants for DeploylessPredeployQueryer

This document outlines test invariants for the `DeploylessPredeployQueryer` contract, focusing on edge cases and ensuring comprehensive coverage of its functionalities.

**1. Constructor Invariants:**

* **Invariant 1: Target Contract Deployment Success:**
    * **Condition:** `target` contract does not exist prior to contract construction.
    * **Input:** Valid `factory`, `factoryCalldata`, and `target` address.
    * **Expected Behavior:**
        * `target` contract is successfully deployed at the provided `target` address.
        * Constructor executes successfully without reverting.
    * **Edge Cases:**
        * Insufficient balance to cover deployment costs.
        * `factoryCalldata` targets a different contract address.
        * `factory` has a faulty deployment mechanism.

* **Invariant 2: Target Contract Deployment Failure:**
    * **Condition:** `target` contract does not exist prior to contract construction.
    * **Input:** Invalid `factory`, `factoryCalldata`, or `target` address.
    * **Expected Behavior:**
        * Constructor reverts with an error.
    * **Edge Cases:**
        * `factory` throws an error during deployment.
        * `factory` deploys to an incorrect address.
        * `factoryCalldata` is malformed.

* **Invariant 3: Target Contract Pre-Exists:**
    * **Condition:** `target` contract already exists prior to contract construction.
    * **Input:** Any valid input parameters.
    * **Expected Behavior:**
        * Constructor does not attempt to deploy the `target` contract.
        * Constructor executes successfully without reverting.

* **Invariant 4: Target Query Execution Success:**
    * **Condition:** `target` contract exists (pre-existing or deployed).
    * **Input:** Valid `targetQueryCalldata` for the `target` contract.
    * **Expected Behavior:**
        * All queries in `targetQueryCalldata` are executed successfully.
        * Constructor returns a byte array containing the return data of each query.
    * **Edge Cases:**
        * One or more queries in `targetQueryCalldata` revert.
        * `targetQueryCalldata` contains invalid function signatures.
        * `targetQueryCalldata` contains incorrect argument encoding.

* **Invariant 5: Target Query Execution Failure:**
    * **Condition:** `target` contract exists (pre-existing or deployed).
    * **Input:** Invalid `targetQueryCalldata` for the `target` contract.
    * **Expected Behavior:**
        * Constructor reverts with an error.
    * **Edge Cases:**
        * One or more queries in `targetQueryCalldata` revert due to contract logic.
        * `targetQueryCalldata` contains calls to non-existent functions.

**2. General Invariants:**

* **Invariant 6: Gas Efficiency:**
    * **Condition:** Any function call to the deployed contract.
    * **Expected Behavior:**
        * Gas consumption should be optimized and comparable to direct interaction with the `target` contract.
    * **Testing:**
        * Compare gas costs of using the `DeploylessPredeployQueryer` versus direct interaction.

* **Invariant 7: Revert Data Propagation:**
    * **Condition:** A query in `targetQueryCalldata` or the deployment process reverts.
    * **Expected Behavior:**
        * The constructor should revert with the exact revert data from the failing call.
    * **Testing:**
        * Trigger reverts in the `target` contract or `factory` and verify the returned revert data.

**3. Edge Case Considerations:**

* **Empty `targetQueryCalldata`:** Test behavior with an empty array.
* **Large `targetQueryCalldata`:** Test with a large number of queries to assess gas limits and potential errors.
* **Zero address as `target`:** Test behavior and error handling.
* **Different Solidity versions:** Test compatibility with different Solidity compiler versions.

**Testing Methodology:**

* Utilize Foundry's testing framework for comprehensive unit testing.
* Employ fuzzing techniques to test with a wide range of inputs and identify unexpected behavior.
* Simulate different blockchain environments and network conditions.

By thoroughly testing these invariants and edge cases, we can ensure the robustness and reliability of the `DeploylessPredeployQueryer` contract.
